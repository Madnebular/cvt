========
- ActiveShape
	o Image::sampleLine
	o Edge-based optimization for model -> to get Similarity and basis components
	o Track faces and expressions
- AAM
	o use ActiveShape to build/calc PCA of face
	o face recognition using PCA of faces
	o Intensity based optimization for model -> to get Similarity and basis components

- Refactor GFX system:
	o add GFXEngineGL, GFXEngineGLWin GFXEngineGLFBO, GFXEngineRaster
	o GFXEngine
		- add stroke, fill of polygons


Sebastian:
==========
