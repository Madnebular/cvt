Camera
=======

	IMPORTANT

- nextFrame: bool nextFrame( timeout );
- callback on new Frame ?

Image
=====
- IKernel interface for convolution
- unmap without pointer

GUI
===
- Add startAnimation( FPS ), stopAnimation to Widget
- Add basic widgets ( Label/Slider)
- Make bounds of text calculateable in GFX
- Extend GFX
- Add KeyEvents
- Add Plot widget for data

Math
====
- more Lie parametrized transforms (pose abstraction)

Vision/GFX
==========
- filter interface Ã¼berarbeiten -> fix ParameterSet
- AGAST filtern
- BSP Tree ( doom src )
- Rapid
- Integral image
- Guided filter
- Haar-Cascade/AdaBoost -> face detection ?

General
=======
- Red-Black-Tree

Philipp:
========
- DLT for PointSet
- PCA class in math
- ActiveShape
	o GFXGL::drawLines
	o Image::sampleLine
	o Edge-based optimization for model -> to get Similarity and basis components
	o Track faces and expressions
- AAM
	o use ActiveShape to build/calc PCA of face
	o face recognition using PCA of faces
	o Intensity based optimization for model -> to get Similarity and basis components

- Refactor GFX system:
	o add class Drawable ( or Paintable or whatever )

		Drawable:
			GFXEngine* getGFXEngine()

	o add class GFXEngine provided by a Drawable and used by GFX to draw into the Drawable
		Drawing code:				GFX:
		GFX gfx( Drawable )   ->	_engine = Drawable.getGFXEngine();



Sebastian:
==========
- remove boost from cmake
- make a template application for the gui
- implement CPU version of GaussIIR
- use smoothing in PatchGenerator and test it with ferns
- implement SE3 Pose representation
- refactor Levenberg-Marquard
- Feature Tracking
	o revisit PTAM and other papers
	o implement active patch search
- SBA: refactor to use SE3
- RBA
